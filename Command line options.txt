                                     on speed. Provide behaviour name (bn)
                                     and maximum speed (sn) for each
                                     behaviour required as a comma
                                     separated list. No spaces in
                                     parameter list. Default is

                                     ,10.0>
 -c,--CoordinatesFence <N,W,S,E>     Ignore coordinates outside the region
                                     <N,W,S,E>. Comma separated decimal

 -cg,--GlitchSpeed <speed>           Minimum speed considered as a single
                                     point gps glitch. Data point will be
                                     removed if adjacent points provide
                                     movement with speed below the
                                     specified value.
 -cte,--EndTime <hh:mm:ss>           Ignore daily data after the specified
                                     time.

                                     specified time. If StartTime greater
                                     than EndTime then overnight period.

                                     required). Ignored if -fd used.
 -fd,--Folder <folder>               Input folder/directory containing
                                     data files. If neither file (-f) or
                                     folder (-fd) is specified all files
                                     in the current working folder will be
                                     used subject to any suffix
                                     specification set with -fs
 -fs,--Suffix <suffix>               Suffix to be used to select input
                                     file names. Include the '.' when the
                                     suffix is a file type extension. e.g.
                                     .TXT Do not use for -f option where
                                     complete filename is used. Omission
                                     in conjunction with -fd will process
                                     every file in the folder.
 -g,--GroupTime <min:max>            Time resolution of data to consider.
                                     Each sequential set of coordinates
                                     that satisfy this range is considered
                                     a sample group ie. a track segment
                                     that includes movements between min
                                     and max seconds duration. Extracts
                                     sample group sequences from a mixed
                                     resulution data set. Defult is all
                                     data.
 -ge,--TrimGroupEnd <n>              Remove n points from the end of each
                                     sample group.
 -gg,--TrimGroupBelowSpeed <speed>   All movements before or after a
                                     movement greater than the specified
                                     speed are removed from each group.
 -gs,--TrimGroupStart <n>            Remove n of points from the start of
                                     each sample group.
 -h,--help                           This page. In case of problems or
                                     queries contact nns@aber.ac.uk .
 -m,--MovementAverage <time>         Average the movement speed data over
                                     the specified time period (seconds).
                                     Omission or 0 value will result in no
                                     averaging of movements.
 -p,--PositionAverage <dist>         Average the position coordinates over
                                     the specified distance (meters) prior
                                     to generating movements. Smooths gps
                                     track in the presence of gps lockup
                                     or gps noise. Alternatively set to 0
                                     to combine non-moving sequences (gps
                                     lockup) into a single longer duration
                                     move. Default if not set 2.0m
 -v,--Verbose                        Detailed output of the processing
                                     steps. Use for explanation or
                                     debugging (can be long so redirect to
                                     a file).

Beferrer accepts comma delimeted text files as input. Each valid line should contain
four items: lat, long, date, time. Lat and long are decimals. Dates are in dd/mm/yyyy 
format and times in hh:mm:ss format. An example of a valid line of data is:
52.439037, -3.993740, 27/5/2018, 10:5:54
Any lines that do not contain four items in this format are ignored.

Output files are created in the same folder as the input data.
These file names include a compact version of the (non default) command line options
to allow output to be easily preserved if the tool is run with different options.

A summary of the processing steps is output to the terminal. More detailed 
information can be produced using the -v (or --Verbose) option.

The tool also produces several data files for the widely used (free) gnuplot tool to 
allow quick visual sanity checking of the results. Obtain gnuplot from:
http://www.gnuplot.info
Assuming that gnuplot is properly installed, the contents of the file prefixed
'gnuplot_commands' can be pasted onto the command line (after setting the working folder 
to the location of the output) to produce .eps graphs.
These files contain gnuplot commands and the relevant data, in plain text format and can 
be edited as desired, e.g. to change line widths, axis ranges, titles etc.
