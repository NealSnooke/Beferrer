# Beferrer
A small java project to process data created by some bespoke animal tags.

# Operation Overview
The program accepts as input a text file full of raw data uploaded from the tags. 

It processes that data in a number of steps controlled by the command line parameters (described in detail elsewhere) to produce .csv files that contain the cleaned and processed data and behaviour categorisation. 

In addition .gnuplot text files are produces that contain a script and data that can be used by the gnuplot tool (http://www.gnuplot.info) to directly produce graphs. The .gnuplot file can be simply provided to the gnuplot command as a parameter and it will produce .eps output that can be viewed in most .pdf viwers.
